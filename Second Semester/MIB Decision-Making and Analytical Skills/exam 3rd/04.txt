The attached Exam_SKIB351_2023-24-1_task5_vA.xlsx file contains the individual characteristics of the passengers of Titanic: gender (sex = 1 for males, sex = 2 for females); the class where they travelled on (pclass), age (age) and whether they survived the catastrophe (survived = 1). Create a classification on survival using the Naïve Bayes approach in Orange (using all the other variables). There is no need to create a training and a test sample in this exercise.

Work in Orange and answer the following questions:

Analyse the effects of class on survival probability by applying the Naïve Bayesian method in Orange. (10 points)
Evaluate the results based on the percent of correctly predicted observations. (15 points)
Upload the Orange Workflow file (.ows) you created. Simply stating answers without work shown results in 1 point for each correct answer.
