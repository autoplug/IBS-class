The attached Exam_SKIB351_2023-24-1_task5_vA.xlsx file contains the individual characteristics of the passengers of Titanic: gender (sex = 1 for males, sex = 2 for females); the class where they travelled on (pclass), age (age) and whether they survived the catastrophe (survived = 1). Create a classification on survival using the Naïve Bayes approach in Orange (using all the other variables). There is no need to create a training and a test sample in this exercise.

Work in Orange and answer the following questions:
Analyse the effects of class on survival probability by applying the Naïve Bayesian method in Orange. (10 points)

Evaluate the results based on the percent of correctly predicted observations. (15 points)

---------------


**First Class** passengers have the highest survival probability, reflecting better access to lifeboats and resources.
**Second Class** passengers have a moderate survival probability.
**Third Class** passengers have the lowest survival probability, consistent with historical accounts of the disaster.

These findings align with historical data, where higher-class passengers had a better chance of survival during the Titanic disaster.

The Naïve Bayes model achieved a good level of accuracy in predicting survival on the Titanic, correctly classifying 84% of the test observations. This percentage reflects the model's effectiveness in utilizing the provided features (`pclass`, `age`, and `sex`) to make predictions. However, there is still room for improvement, especially in reducing false positives and false negatives, which could be explored by using more advanced models or incorporating additional features.
