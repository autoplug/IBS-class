The attached Exam_SKIB351_2022-23-1_task5_vA.xlsx Excel file contains the individual characteristics of the passengers of Titanic: gender (sex = 1 for males, sex = 2 for females); the class where they travelled on (pclass), age (age) and whether they survived the catastrophe (survived = 1). Create a 65% training sample and run a classification model on survival using the Decision Tree approach in Orange (using all the other variables and maximal tree depth of 5).
Execute the analysis in Orange and answer the following questions:

• Based on the results of the Decision Tree method, can you observe any connection between class and survival probability? (10 points)

• Evaluate the model based on recall using the test sample (target: survived = 1). Please also interpret this metric. (15 points)
