since the R Square with value of 0.07 and multipleR with value 0.26 is very low we can conclude that there is no strong linear relation between grade and Student evaluation of teaching.
Although the p-value is less that 5% that it means that we reject H0.
H0 in this sample means that the intercept is zero.by rejecting H0 we can conclude that the formula for regression is :

Student evaluation of teaching = Grade * 0.248 + 3.15
