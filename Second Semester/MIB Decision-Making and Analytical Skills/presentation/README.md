# Slide 1

Nancy krentz is the manager of a property apprisal service locate in York, Pennsylvania.
She has four appraisers but she is worried that the appraisals of comparable properties produced by her four appraisers are often not equivalent.

She wants to look into the matter to see if her concerns are valid or not.

# Slide 2

Nancy asks her administrative assistant, Katie Shaffer, to identify 40 similar properties in the York area for the study.

Nancy then arbitrarily divides the 40 properties into four subsets of ten. Next, she randomly assigns each subset to one of the four appraisers for assessment.

we are going to explain how to analyse the data and answer some of nancy questions.

# Slide 3

we have four basic conditions:
1.The distribution of the response variable follows a normal distribution.
2.These distributions have the same variance.
3.Each sample is an independent random sample.

# Slide 4

I calculate the mean and varince of each group in this table.

ANOVA should not be used in this situation since the variance and standard deviations are not equal and have a significant amount of difference between them.

from the other side we do not know if this data follow normal distribution.
This issue is not mentioned anywhere in the question

# Slide 5

the statistical analysis confirm her suspicion that there are individual differences among the four appraisers

As a result, by looking at the p-value shown above in the output summary of One-Way ANOVA test, it can be said that there is evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis because on comparing this value with 0.05, it is found that p-value is very less than 0.05.

In general,Â if the p-value is smaller than 5%, then the null hypothesis is rejected, and the alternative hypothesis is supported. If the null hypothesis is rejected, one concludes that the means of all the groups are not equal.

# Slide 6

For this reason i calculate ANOVA and difference mean between every two person.

The minimum absolute difference between Allen and Maloy.
