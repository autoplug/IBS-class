emh states that the prevailing asset prices in the market fully reflect all available information.
he efficient market hypothesis (EMH) theorizes about the relationship between the:

- Information Availability in the Market
- Current Market Trading Prices (i.e. Share Prices of Public Equities)

According to the efficient market hypothesis, prices will instantly change to reflect the market-determined, "accurate" price upon the introduction of new information or data to the public markets.

According to EMH, all relevant information has already been "priced in," which means that the assets have been valued at their fair market value. As a result, if EMH is accurate, the inference is that persistently outperforming the market is very difficult.

1. weak form

   The weak form implies that all historical price data is reflected in the stock prices as of today and that no type of technical analysis can be used to help traders or investors make decisions.

   Supporters of the weak form efficiency theory contend that by using fundamental analysis to identify cheap and overvalued stocks, investors can boost their odds of outperforming the market by investigating the financial statements of the companies they invest in.

2. Semi-Strong Form

   The semi-strong form efficiency hypothesis holds that since the current price of a stock is determined using all public information, Technical or fundamental analysis cannot be used by investors to increase their returns in the market.

   According to proponents of this idea, the only information that can assist investors in increasing their returns to a performance level above that of the general market is information that is not easily accessible to the public.

3. Strong Form

   According to the efficient market hypothesis' strong form, all information, including that which is known to the public and that which is unknown to the public, is fully accounted for in the stock prices as they are right now. As a result, there is no information that can give an investor a competitive edge.

   According to proponents of this school of thought, no matter what data is found or study is done, investors cannot expect returns on their investments that are higher than typical market returns.
