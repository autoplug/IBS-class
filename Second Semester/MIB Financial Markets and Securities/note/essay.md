# Connection of Risk and return

First is the principle that risk and return are directly related. The greater the risk that an investment may lose money, the greater its potential for providing a substantial return. By the same token, the smaller the risk an investment poses, the smaller the potential return it will provide.

Another way to look at it is that for a given level of return, it is human nature to prefer less risk to more risk. Therefore, the higher the risk of an investment, the higher its returns have to be to attract investors.

The existence of risk does not mean that you should not invest – only that you should be aware that any investment has some degree of risk which should be considered when deciding whether the expected returns of that investment are worth it.

Therefore, when considering the suitability of any investment, you must understand both the likely returns and the risks involved. The appropriate risk-return combination will depend on your financial objectives. Some people prefer a low-risk, steady income stream while others don’t mind taking on more risk for the chance of making higher returns.

# What is the rationale behind the mutual fund investment

Mutual funds let you pool your money with other investors to "mutually" buy stocks, bonds, and other investments. They're run by professional money managers who decide which securities to buy (stocks, bonds, etc.) and when to sell them. You get exposure to all the investments in the fund and any income they generate.

# Comparison of Mutual fund differences and its benefits/drawback

- Mutual funds are one of the most popular investment choices in the U.S.
- Advantages for investors include advanced portfolio management, dividend reinvestment, risk reduction, convenience, and fair pricing.
- Disadvantages include high fees, tax inefficiency, poor trade execution, and the potential for management abuses.

# Efficient Market Hypothesis

The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is a financial economics theory suggesting that asset prices reflect all the available information. According to the EMH hypothesis, neither fundamental, nor technical analysis may produce risk-adjusted excess returns consistently, since market prices should only react to new information.

# Comparison and use of fundamental and technical analysis

1. Fundamental Analysis is a method of examining security so as to identify its intrinsic value for long term investment opportunities. As against, Technical Analysis is a method of evaluating and forecasting the price of a security in future, on the basis of price movement and volume of transaction. It identifies what a stock will do in future.

2. In fundamental analysis, longer periods are used to analyse stocks as compared to technical analysis. Hence, fundamental analysis is employed by those investors who want to invest in stocks whose value will increase in several years. On the contrary, technical analysis is used when the trade is for short term only.

3. The time difference between the two analysis is not only experienced in their approach but in their objective too, wherein the technical analysis is concerned with trading, fundamental analysis talks about investment. As most of the investors use fundamental analysis to buy or hold stocks of the company, whereas traders rely on the technical analysis, to make short term profits.

4. While fundamental analysis aims at ascertaining the true intrinsic value of the stock, technical analysis is used to identify the right time to enter or exit the market.

5. In fundamental analysis, decision making is based on the information available and statistic evaluated. On the contrary, in technical analysis, decision making is based on market trends and the stock price.

6. In fundamental analysis, both past and present data are considered, whereas, in technical analysis, only past data is considered.

7. Fundamental Analysis is based on financial statements, whereas technical analysis is based on charts with price movements.

8. In fundamental Analysis the intrinsic value of the stock can be ascertained by analysing an income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, profit margin, return on equity, price to earnings ratio, etc. However, technical analysts rely on the chart patterns (such as continuation pattern and reverse patterns), price actions, technical indicator, resistance and support, to analyse the future price trends. Here resistance is the point where the investor is of the view that price will not rise further and is ready to sell, and support is a point where the investor is of the view that price will not fall further and is ready to buy.

9. In fundamental analysis, the future price of the security is decided upon the past and present performance and profitability of the company. As opposed, in technical analysis the future prices are on the basis of charts and indicators.

10. Fundamental analysis is done by long term position trader, while technical analysis is done by swing trader and short term day trader.

# Options different types, characteristics, benefits

- What Is an Option?

  The term option refers to a financial instrument that is based on the value of underlying securities such as stocks. An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell—depending on the type of contract they hold—the underlying asset. Unlike futures, the holder is not required to buy or sell the asset if they decide against it.

- What are the 4 types of options?

  There are four basic options positions: buying a call option, selling a call option, buying a put option, and selling a put option. With call options, the buyer is betting that the market price of an underlying asset will exceed a predetermined price, called the strike price, while the seller is betting it won't.

- Benefits

  1. Options are financial derivatives that give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price and date.

  2. Call options and put options form the basis for a wide range of option strategies designed for hedging, income, or speculation.

  3. Options trading can be used for both hedging and speculation, with strategies ranging from simple to complex.

  4. Although there are many opportunities to profit with options, investors should carefully weigh the risks.

# Equity evaluation methods

  1. Discounted Cash Flow Method
  2. Comparable Company Analysis

# Financial Ratios

A financial ratio or accounting ratio is a relative magnitude of two selected numerical values taken from an enterprise's financial statements. Often used in accounting, there are many standard ratios used to try to evaluate the overall financial condition of a corporation or other organization.

# Duration and its importance

Duration can measure how long it takes, in years, for an investor to be repaid a bond's price by the bond's total cash flows. Duration can also measure the sensitivity of a bond's or fixed income portfolio's price to changes in interest rates.
