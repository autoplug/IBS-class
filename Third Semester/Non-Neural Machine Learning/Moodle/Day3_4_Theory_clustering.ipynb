        "\n",
        "* **Data Entry Errors:** Human errors such as errors caused during data collection, recording, or entry can cause outliers in data. For example: Annual income of a customer is  100,000 USD. Accidentally, the data entry operator puts an additional zero in the figure. Now the income becomes 1,000,000 USD which is 10 times higher. Evidently, this will be the outlier value when compared with rest of the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Measurement Error:** It is the most common source of outliers. This is caused when the measurement instrument used turns out to be faulty. For example: There are 10 weighing machines. 9 of them are correct, 1 is faulty. Weight measured by people on the faulty machine will be higher / lower than the rest of people in the group. The weights measured on faulty machine can lead to outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Experimental Error:** Another cause of outliers is experimental error. For example: In a 100m sprint of 7 runners, one runner missed out on concentrating on the ‘Go’ call which caused him to start late. Hence, this caused the runner’s run time to be longer than other runners. His total run time can be an outlier.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Intentional Outlier:** This is commonly found in self-reported measures that involves sensitive data. For example: Teens would typically under report the amount of alcohol that they consume. Only a fraction of them would report actual value. Here actual values might look like outliers because the rest of the teens are under reporting the consumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Data Processing Error:** Whenever we perform data mining, we extract data from multiple sources. It is possible that some manipulation or extraction errors may lead to outliers in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Sampling error:** For instance, we have to measure the height of athletes. By mistake, we include a few basketball players in the sample. This inclusion is likely to cause outliers in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Natural Outlier:** When an outlier is not artificial (due to error), it is a natural outlier. For instance: In my last assignment with a renowned insurance company, I noticed that the performance of top 50 financial advisors was far higher than rest of the population. Surprisingly, it was not due to any error. Hence, whenever we perform any data mining activity with advisors, we treat this segment separately.\n"
