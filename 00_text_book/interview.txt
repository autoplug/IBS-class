@tell me yourself:
I have been a software developer and architect for the last 7 years developing isomorphic applications using JavaScript and its ecosystem as the main technology. In the last few years, my role was mostly focused on developing platform agnostic UIs using different libraries and frameworks like React.js, Redux, and Angular. I have also experience developing restful apis using node.js

@current job:

-----------------------------------------------------
@Conflict:
In my previous position, while working on a project team, a coworker would continuously put down the suggestions of both myself and my other coworkers during project meetings. The individual would also constantly interrupt the speaker and interject their thoughts. We found it extremely disruptive.

After looking at the situation with some perspective, I recognized the team was under a lot of pressure to complete the project and that we were all doing our best. I adjusted my communication style with this individual and approached our conversations with empathy and more time for discussion if they didn't feel heard.

As a result, we were able to finish up the project on time and everyone were happy with the end result.
-----------------------------------------------------
@under the pressure:
When I am under pressure, I do my best to focus on the work itself and getting the job done rather being stress out. If I realize the we won't be able to meet the deadline, I will communicate that with my mangers to make sure they are aware and they can mitigate the risk

@What would your [coworker] say about you?
I would expect that most coworkers would describe me as driven. When I join teams or start on projects, I spend a lot of time understanding what’s most important about the work, which is a huge motivating factor for me. Once I lock in on what matters most, I share it with the team so we’re all invested with a common purpose. Being driven allows me to share what some have called my “infectious
-----------------------------------------------------
@Tell me about a time you [disagreed] with someone.
Occasional conflicts are a fact of life.
In most cases, I handle conflict well. I value diversity and understand that different people have different opinions, which may lead to conflict. When faced with conflict, I work to collaborate with others to resolve the issue in a way that is mutually beneficial for everyone involved. Sometimes, I can become defensive when trying to express my opinion. I am practicing tactics to manage this behavior, such as pausing to take a deep breath and carefully considering my words before responding.
-----------------------------------------------------
@Describe a situation when you had a [conflict] at work and how you handled it.
While working on a project for a previous employer, one of my team members regularly challenged every solution I presented. He also had a tendency to interrupt and talk over others without listening to their input. I experienced a challenge in maintaining my patience when he interrupted others without listening. It reached a point where our respective managers counseled both of us on our behavior

To resolve this conflict, I had to recognize that I cannot change or control his behavior. I also acknowledged that this behavior, from both of us, was likely a result of stress due to the heavy workload of the project. Therefore, I adjusted my own communication style to increase empathy, avoid triggers and build patience with interruptions. We were able to complete the project and maintain polite correspondence whenever we needed to work together after that.
