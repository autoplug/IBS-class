1.What is a Hash Table? How can we use this structure to find all anagrams in a dictionary?

A Hash table is a data structure for storing values to keys of arbitrary type. The Hash table consists of an index into an array by using a Hash function. Indexes are used to store the elements. We assign each possible element to a bucket by using a hash function. Multiple keys can be assigned to the same bucket, so all the key and value pairs are stored in lists within their respective buckets. Right hashing function has a great impact on performance.

2.What is Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm?

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path from a starting node to the target node in a weighted graph. The algorithm makes a tree of shortest paths from the starting vertex and source vertex to all other nodes in the graph.

Suppose you want to go from home to office in the shortest possible way. You know some roads are heavily congested and challenging to use this, means these edges have a large weight. In Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path tree found by the algorithm will try to avoid edges with larger weights.

3.What Are The Criteria Of Algorithm Analysis?

An algorithm is generally analyzed by two factors.

  I.Time complexity
 II.Space complexity

Time complexity deals with the quantification of the amount of time taken by a set of code or algorithm to process or run as a function of the amount of input. In other words, the time complexity is efficiency or how long a program function takes to process a given input.

Space complexity is the amount of memory used by the algorithm to execute and produce the result.
